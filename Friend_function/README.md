Friend Function in C++

This folder contains C++ programs demonstrating the concept of friend functions in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Overview

In C++, a friend function is a function that is not a member of a class but still has the access privileges to the private and protected members of the class. Friend functions are useful when you want certain functions to access private data without making them part of the class.

Key Points

Declared inside the class with the keyword friend.

Can access private, protected, and public members of the class.

Not called using an object, but can take objects as arguments.

Helps in implementing operations that involve multiple classes.
