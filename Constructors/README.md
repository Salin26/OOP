# Constructors Folder

## Overview

This folder contains examples of how to use constructors in C++ classes. Constructors are special member functions used to initialize objects of a class.

## Example Files

- `Product.cpp` : Constructor initializing product ID, name, price, and quantity.  

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the `Constructors` folder:
2. Compile a file (example: `ParkingSlot.cpp`):

## Learning Outcome

- Understand default and parameterized constructors.  
- Learn how constructors help in initializing objects easily.  
- Practice creating multiple classes and objects with constructors.
