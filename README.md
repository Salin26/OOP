# OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Repository

This repository contains C++ programs and examples covering all major OOP concepts and C++ basics.

## Topics Covered

1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - Creating and using classes and objects  
   - Access specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)  

2. **Constructors and Destructors**  
   - Default and parameterized constructors  
   - Destructor usage  

3. **Arrays of Objects**  
   - Storing multiple objects in arrays  
   - Iterating through objects  

4. **Friend Functions**  
   - Accessing private members using friend functions  

5. **Inheritance**  
   - Single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance  
   - Base and derived class relationships  

6. **Polymorphism**  
   - Compile-time (function overloading, operator overloading)  
   - Run-time (virtual functions)  

7. **Encapsulation**  
   - Hiding internal data with private members  
   - Public member functions for controlled access  

8. **Other C++ Basics**  
   - Variables, data types, input/output  
   - Loops, conditionals, and functions  
   - Arrays, strings, and basic standard library usage
